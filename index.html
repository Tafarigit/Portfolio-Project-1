                <br>               
                the card you draw goes in a drawn card pile and

                <br>
                Draw from the deck until you draw a card from the deck that beats your hole card.

                if the second card you draw is higher than the first card you draw,
                <br>
                 you must put the both cards back in the deck and reshuflle the deck.
            <li>If your card is the same point value as the card you draw
                <br>
                 then that card goes to the drawn card pile and no points are earned, draw new card.</li>
